# Introduction
```
VisualPass is a web-based soccer passing analyser designed to provide valuable insights into passing patterns, ball coordinates, player interactions, and key actions in soccer matches Leveraging the Wyscout dataset, VisualPass contributes to sports visualization research by offering a unique perspective on soccer strategies and player performances. Implemented using React, D3.js, Python, and Tailwind CSS, VisualPass provides interactive and dynamic visualizations that enhance the understanding of soccer tactics. This project showcases the potential of advanced visualization techniques in sports analysis, paving the way for future advancements in soccer analytics

# Charts Implemented 


<b>Radar Chart</b> The radar chart in VisualPass is used to display the position of players, such as LW (Left Wing), RW (Right Wing), and CF (Centre Forward), as well as goals scored. This chart provides a visual representation of player positioning and their goal-scoring capabilities, allowing users to analyse player performance based on their positions on the field.

<b>Pie Chart</b> The pie chart in VisualPass is utilized to visualize the different types of passes made during a soccer match. This chart categorizes passes into various types, such as short passes long passes, through balls, and crosses, providing insights into the passing strategies employed by teams during the game.

<b>Map</b> The map visualization in VisualPass is used to display data related to top soccer leagues in Europe. This map can show various statistics and information related to these leagues, such as team locations, match locations, or other geographical data relevant to soccer analysis.

<b>Passing Simulator</b> The passing simulator in VisualPass is a tool that allows users to simulate passes made by players during a soccer game. This simulator can be used to recreate specific scenarios or analyse passing sequences, providing a deeper understanding of passing dynamics in soccer matches.

<b>Heatmap</b> The heatmap in VisualPass is used to display the positions of the ball throughout a soccer match. This visualization highlights areas of the field where the ball is most frequently located, providing insights into possession, transitions, and overall gameplay patterns. 

<b>Network Graph</b> The network graph in VisualPass is employed to visualize phase-wise
passing networks during a soccer match. This graph illustrates the connections and interactions
between players through passes, helping users analyse team strategies and passing patterns
during different phases of the game.
